. To apply the behavior to all confidential clients select _client-access-type_ in the *Condition Type* field

[NOTE]
====
To apply to a specific group of clients, another approach would be to select the _client-roles_ type in the *Condition Type* field. In this way, you could create specific roles and assign a custom rotation configuration to each role.
