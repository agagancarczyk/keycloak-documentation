|Configuration|Description

|SSO Session Idle
|This setting is for OIDC clients only. If a user is inactive for longer than this timeout, the user session is invalidated. This timeout value resets when clients request authentication or send a refresh token request. {project_name} adds a window of time to the idle timeout before the session invalidation takes effect. See the <<_idle_timeouts_note, note>> later in this section.

|SSO Session Max
|The maximum time before a user session expires.

|SSO Session Idle Remember Me
|This setting is similar to the standard SSO Session Idle configuration but specific to logins with *Remember Me* enabled. Users can specify longer session idle timeouts when they click *Remember Me* when logging in. This setting is an optional configuration and, if its value is not greater than zero, it uses the same idle timeout as the SSO Session Idle configuration.

|SSO Session Max Remember Me
|This setting is similar to the standard SSO Session Max but specific to *Remember Me* logins. Users can specify longer sessions when they click *Remember Me* when logging in. This setting is an optional configuration and, if its value is not greater than zero, it uses the same session lifespan as the SSO Session Max configuration.

|Client Session Idle
|If the user is inactive for longer than this timeout, refresh token requests bump the idle timeout. This setting specifies a shorter idle timeout of refresh tokens than the session idle timeout, but users can override it for individual clients. This setting is an optional configuration and, when set to zero, uses the same idle timeout in the SSO Session Idle configuration.

|Client Session Max
|The maximum time before a refresh token expires and invalidates. This setting specifies a shorter timeout of refresh tokens than the session timeout, but users can override it for individual clients. This setting is an optional configuration and, when set to zero, uses the same idle timeout in the SSO Session Max configuration.

[[_offline-session-idle]]
|Offline Session Idle
|This setting is for <<_offline-access, offline access>>. The amount of time the session remains idle before {project_name} revokes its offline token. {project_name} adds a window of time to the idle timeout before the session invalidation takes effect. See the <<_idle_timeouts_note, note>> later in this section.

[[_offline-session-max-limited]]
|Offline Session Max Limited
|This setting is for <<_offline-access, offline access>>. If this flag is *ON*, Offline Session Max can control the maximum time the offline token remains active, regardless of user activity. Client Offline Session Idle and Client Offline Session Max are enabled.

[[_offline-session-max]]
|Offline Session Max
|This setting is for <<_offline-access, offline access>>, and it is the maximum time before {project_name} revokes the corresponding offline token. This option controls the maximum amount of time the offline token remains active, regardless of user activity.

|Login timeout
|The total time a logging in must take. If authentication takes longer than this time, the user must start the authentication process again.

|Login action timeout
|The Maximum time users can spend on any one page during the authentication process.

[NOTE]
====
For idle timeouts, a two-minute window of time exists that the session is active. For example, when you have the timeout set to 30 minutes, it will be 32 minutes before the session expires. 

This action is necessary for some scenarios in cluster and cross-data center environments where the token refreshes on one cluster node a short time before the expiration and the other cluster nodes incorrectly consider the session as expired because they have not yet received the message about a successful refresh from the refreshing node.
