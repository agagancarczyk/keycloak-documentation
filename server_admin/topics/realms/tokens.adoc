|===
|Configuration|Description

|Default Signature Algorithm
|The default algorithm used to assign tokens for the realm.

[[_revoke-refresh-token]]
|Revoke Refresh Token
|When *Enabled*, {project_name} revokes refresh tokens and issues another token that the client must use. This action applies to OIDC clients performing the refresh token flow.

|Access Token Lifespan
|When {project_name} creates an OIDC access token, this value controls the lifetime of the token.

|Access Token Lifespan For Implicit Flow
|With the Implicit Flow, {project_name} does not provide a refresh token. A separate timeout exists for access tokens created by the Implicit Flow.

|Client login timeout
|The maximum time before clients must finish the Authorization Code Flow in OIDC.

|User-Initiated Action Lifespan
|The maximum time before a user's action permission expires. Keep this value short because users generally react to self-created actions quickly.

|Default Admin-Initiated Action Lifespan
|The maximum time before an action permission sent to a user by an administrator expires. Keep this value long to allow administrators to send e-mails to offline users. An administrator can override the default timeout before issuing the token.

|Email Verification
| Specifies independent timeout for email verification.

|IdP account email verification
| Specifies independent timeout for IdP account email verification.

|Forgot password
| Specifies independent timeout for forgot password.

|Execute actions
| Specifies independent timeout for execute actions.

[[_idle_timeouts_note]]

[NOTE]
====
For idle timeouts, a two-minute window of time exists that the session is active. For example, when you have the timeout set to 30 minutes, it will be 32 minutes before the session expires. 

This action is necessary for some scenarios in cluster and cross-data center environments where the token refreshes on one cluster node a short time before the expiration and the other cluster nodes incorrectly consider the session as expired because they have not yet received the message about a successful refresh from the refreshing node.
