Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only::
  *Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only* is for testing Content Security Policies. https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/[Learn more].

X-Content-Type-Options::

X-Robots-Tag::
  *X-Robots-Tag* prevents pages from appearing in search engines. https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/robots_meta_tag[Learn more].

X-XSS-Protection::
  *X-XSS-Protection* configures the Cross-site scripting (XSS) filter in your browser. Using the default behaviour, the browser will prevent rendering of the page when a XSS attack is detected. https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#xxxsp[Learn more].

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)::
  *HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)* The Strict-Transport-Security HTTP header tells browsers to always use HTTPS. Once a browser sees this header, it will only visit the site over HTTPS for the time specified (1 year) at max-age, including the subdomains. https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#hsts[Learn more].
